# Arduino-Car

These files are written by JelleWho and TomVogel in 2018 for an school project where we where making an self driving car. The arduino has 5 sensors connected to it, 2 on the front and 1 on each other side. The difference between the 2 on the front sets the steering direction, the total som of them sets the speed. 

There is a septead thinking 'head' that just does that and says go this speed. Then we have a different peace of code executing that, that code takes sensor data like the potmeter on the steering wheel to determen what todo to make it happen. This code also takes in account the reverse pool delays and such. 
We also have a whopping 2.8 meters of LEDs around the car that is telling us what the car is doing, like steering, going forward /backwards baking and the emergency buttom state. 



This file is here for ease of sharing and book keeping, but also for other fellow student who want to read the program and get some ideas how programming for an arduino is.

You can form me if we made a mistake. And you can contact me if information is missing.
