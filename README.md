# Arduino-Car

These files are written by JelleWho and TomVogel in 2018 for a school project where we where making an self driving car. The Arduino has 5 sensors connected to it, 2 on the front and 1 on each other side. The difference between the 2 on the front sets the steering direction, the total sum of them sets the speed. 

There is a separate thinking 'head' that just does that and says go this speed. Then we have a different piece of code executing that, that code takes sensor data like the pot-meter on the steering wheel to determine what to do to make it happen. This code also takes in account the reverse pool delays and such. 
We also have a whopping 2.8 meters of LEDs around the car that is telling us what the car is doing, like steering, going forward /backwards baking and the emergency button state. 



This file is here for ease of sharing and book keeping, but also for other fellow students who want to read the program and get some ideas how programming for an Arduino is.

You can form me if we made a mistake. And you can contact me if information is missing.
